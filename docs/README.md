# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the central documentation hub for OctoAcme project management processes. This README provides an overview of how we run projects and quick links to all core process documents.

## Overview: How OctoAcme Runs Projects

OctoAcme’s project management framework is designed to create clarity, ensure cross-functional collaboration, and deliver consistently high-quality results. The process begins with a structured initiation phase to define the problem space, align stakeholders, and set measurable goals. Once a project is authorized, planning focuses on breaking down work, identifying dependencies, and mapping out milestones with clear responsibilities.

Key roles are clearly defined: Project Managers drive delivery and manage risks, Product Managers set outcomes and priorities, Developers implement and maintain quality, with QA and stakeholders fully engaged throughout. Team communication is structured through daily standups, weekly syncs, demos, and proactive risk reporting, ensuring transparency and fast escalation when needed. Quality assurance practices are embedded at every step, including automated and manual testing, pre-release criteria, and structured retrospectives to drive continuous improvement.

## Project Management Workflow

- **Initiation:** Articulate problems, success metrics, and align all relevant stakeholders.
- **Planning:** Break work into increments, document milestones, identify risks and track dependencies.
- **Execution & Tracking:** Use project boards and regular cadences (standups, syncs, demos) for visibility and risk management; deliver iteratively using PRs with quality gates.
- **Risk & Communication:** Maintain and review risk registers, and escalate blockers as needed; provide routine updates and ad-hoc communications to all stakeholders.
- **Release & Deployment:** Apply standardized checklists and playbooks for rollout, verification, announcement, and rollback.
- **Retrospective & Improvement:** Analyze outcomes after each delivery cycle, generate actionable improvements, and follow up to ensure learning is embedded.
